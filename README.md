### Project Description

For our Data Bootcamp project, we decided to study how the domestic housing market has evolved over the course of the last 19 years. Specifically, we wanted to take a look at changes in the demographic and economic factors related to housing price, such as the change in population and income per capita. To best analyze these relationships, we decided to consolidate the data on a county-specific level, which we believe will offer sufficient detail. 

Because this analysis was only conducted on the US housing market, its findings are not applicable to the housing markets in other international countries. Furthermore, because there are many other factors that influence housing price beyond just population and income per capita (quality of education, weather, etc.), this analysis is far from conclusive. Nonetheless, we hope that our project can bring to life some interesting insights.
